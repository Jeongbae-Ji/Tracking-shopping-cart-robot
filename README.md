# Smart Shopping Cart Robot

This project is a ROS 2-based user-tracking shopping cart robot that uses YOLO tracking to follow a specific target, even when the object temporarily leaves the camera view. When the object reappears among similar objects, the robot is able to recognize and continue following the originally tracked target.

## Features

- 🔍 **YOLO Object Detection**: Real-time object recognition using a pretrained YOLO model (`best.pt`).
- 🗺️ **SLAM-Based Navigation**: Uses SLAM for mapping and autonomous navigation.
- 🤖 **ROS 2 Integration**: Developed as a ROS 2 package for modular and scalable robotics development.
- 🧭 **Predefined Map**: Includes `.pgm` and `.yaml` files for indoor localization.
