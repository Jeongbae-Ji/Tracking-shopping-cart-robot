# Smart Shopping Cart Robot

This project is a ROS 2-based intelligent shopping cart robot that combines indoor navigation and object detection to assist in smart logistics scenarios, such as autonomous shopping or item transport.

## Features

- üîç **YOLO Object Detection**: Real-time object recognition using a pretrained YOLO model (`best.pt`).
- üó∫Ô∏è **SLAM-Based Navigation**: Uses SLAM for mapping and autonomous navigation.
- ü§ñ **ROS 2 Integration**: Developed as a ROS 2 package for modular and scalable robotics development.
- üß≠ **Predefined Map**: Includes `.pgm` and `.yaml` files for indoor localization.

## Project Structure

```
